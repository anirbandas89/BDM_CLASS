# BDM_CLASS
This is a modified version of CLASS (https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) code with a customizable extra fluid species included. The Equation of State (EoS) of this fluid is set such that it is relativistic at early time and nonrelativistic at late times. The epoch and duration of the transition between these two phases, and the fraction this new species comprises of all CDM can be given as input.
